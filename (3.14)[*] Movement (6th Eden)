First, calls the method to choose which cell to move to. This choice is made by evaluating the
different options. If the olc cell and the new cell are the same, the method is ended within the
if statement's execution. If not, the entities Map within the oldCell and newCell are updated to
reflect the movement. The entity is removed from the oldCell's list - for something cannot
exist within two places at once, but it can exist in no place in the "physical" realm. Then,
it is added to the newCell's list.

Movement effectively occurs simultaneously for every entity because the survival formula- from
which the movement evaluations are derived- are calculated prior to the movement phase.
