Called by cell.condsFluxCheck if the probability roll is successful.
Causes the property to fluctuate from a Gaussian distribution centered around 0. For the level
fluctuating, the property's flux value serves as the standard deviation. For the flux value,
the surge value serves as the standard deviation.

See (0.01) for the Gaussian distribution methods. I did not design them myself.
