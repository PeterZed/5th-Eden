Returns 'num' number of cryptographically secure pseudo random numbers between 0 and 'max'.

A CSPRNG was chosen over Math.random() to emulate the true randomness of real world physics at its
core, in spite of being slightly slower and more cumbersome to work with efficiently. The Uint32
Array was chosen over smaller Uint arrays because it better approximates a continuous scale rather
than a discrete one.
