mutability is the probability * 100 of a property's non-mutability values undergoing a change from
parent to child when the entity reproduces. mutabilityFlux is the stdDev should mutability
itself undergo a change; mutabilitySurge is the stdDev should mutabilityFlux undergo a change.
metaMutabilityLevel is the probability * 100 of a property's mutability values undergoing a change,
itself included. metaMutabilityFlux is the stdDev should metaMutability itself undergo a change;
metaMutabilitySurge is the stdDev should metaMutabilityFlux undergo a change.

? Energy, Fatigue, and Exhaustion are not implemented at all.

  The flux values are all tentative, currently. I haven't a clue if they'll increase too rapidly or
  not, so it will take a lot of tweaking and experimenting. I've set it up so that, without
  nourishment, it takes 40 ticks before an entity dies of starvation: There are documented cases
  of hunger strikers surviving 36, 38, and even 40 days.  Without water, an entity can survive
  8 ticks: There are documented cases of a person (in comfortable setting) surviving over a week
  without water. These are, of course, assuming optimal situations. Eventually, I'll have it set
  up so that, in conditions with poor temperature and salinity for the entity, it will suffer
  dehydration faster. With more activity, it suffers starvation and thirst faster.
