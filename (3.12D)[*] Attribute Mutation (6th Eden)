Causes the property to undergo a mutation according to a Gaussian distribution centered around 0.
For the level fluctuating, the property's flux value serves as the standard deviation. For flux
values, the relevant surge value serves as the standard deviation. For mutability: mutabilityFlux.
For metaMutability: metaMutabilityFlux.
