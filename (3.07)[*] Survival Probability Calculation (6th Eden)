Calculates the composite probability of survival on each local cell for the entity. The composite
probability on a given cell is the probability of not dying due to health prob and of not dying
due to environmental hazards (i.e., remaining on a cell with wildly- or even mildly-
inappropriate cell conditions).

Then, assigns the probability for this local cell to the appropriate array indices for the
survivalProb nested array that correspond to this target local cell.
