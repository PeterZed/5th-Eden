  Dynamism represents the average number of turns that each cell takes to experience a fluctuation.
  The magnitude of change is based upon the cell's flux for the relevant property. Dynamism also
  influences itself. So, when the level is high, the world is slow to change and the rate of
  change is slow to change. But, when the level is low, the world is quick to change, as is the
  rate of change. Thus, it is the only dynamic qualities in the sim whose level affects its own
  rate of change.
  
  To reach the average number of turns, make it so the probability of change for a given tick
  is 1 / dynamism["level"], and then make the probability roll to de termine.
