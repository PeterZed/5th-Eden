Varies a cell's conditions from its neighbors' based on this Eden's uniformity and variability
values - that is, how similar or dissimilar cells are from each other within the garden, and the
spread of those values.

Cycles through each condition and adjusts the level, flux, dynamism, and dynamismFlux by the mod
values (as determined by the cell.prototype.condsMod function).

? Unknown if sensory and enviro conds will function identically to cylical conds at this time.
