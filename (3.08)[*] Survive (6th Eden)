Checks to see if the entity survives this tick. Makes a probability roll against the chances of its
survival on its present cell.

The "struggle is the probability roll to see if the entity lives or dies, using the deathChance
as the probability of it dying. If struggle > deathChance, the entity beats the odds and lives
another turn, growing older. Otherwise, it perishes and this.death() is invoked.
