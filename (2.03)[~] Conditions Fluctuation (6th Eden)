Called by cell.condsFluxCheck if the probability roll is successful.
Causes the property to fluctuate from a Gaussian distribution centered around 0. For the level
fluctuating, the property's flux value serves as the standard deviation. For the flux value,
the surge value serves as the standard deviation.
