This method is used for initializing all cells who have at least one neighbor whose conditions
have been initialized before theirs have. That is, the initialization of these conditions depends
on the cell's neighbors so as to maintain a statistically smooth transition from one cell to
another for each condition.

First, the initialized cells' conditions are summed together in cell.prototype.localCondsSum().
They are added to the cell's default value - which is null for everything (effectively 0 for
purposes of mathematical operations), except the surge values.

Then, this sum is averaged, dividing by the number of local cells whose conditions have been
initialized.

Lastly, using this Eden's uniformity and variability values, the cell's conditions are
initialized based on the present average, the uniformity of the Eden, and the variability of Eden.
This is calculated with a Gaussian distribution, using uniformity for the average magnitude of
difference and variability as the standard deviation for the distribution; the result is multiplied
by either +1 or -1 (probability roll to determine). This is performed with the varyConds method
of the cell class.
