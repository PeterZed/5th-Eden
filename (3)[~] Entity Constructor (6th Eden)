~ Survival odds calculation has yet to be implemented
~ I have to test if all of this below would work. For example, I'm not sure within the constructor
I can define this.x = xCoord and then just below reference this.x within setting this.localCells,
or if an error would be thrown. I think I've previously tested it though, and it worked out fine.
