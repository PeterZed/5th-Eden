Initializes a cell's conditions' values, independent of its neighbors'.

? Still ongoing development until I work out how I want all of the conditions to act, but otherwise
functions. The initialization of sensoryConds and enviroConds are not yet determined, but I might do them
the same as the cyclicalConds.
